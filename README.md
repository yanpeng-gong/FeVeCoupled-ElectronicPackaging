Coupled Finite Element-Virtual Element method for elasticity analysis of electronic packaging structures with complex multi-scale geometries.

**Published in**: Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements, 184:106640 (2026)

## Features

- **Hybrid FE-VE approach** combining FEM's computational efficiency with VEM's geometric flexibility
- **Electronic packaging applications** for sintered silver interconnects, FC-BGA packages, and IGBT modules
- **Modular code structure** with separate FEM, VEM, and coupling implementations
- **Validated examples** from published research

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
-
